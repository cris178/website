# website
This is my personal website that has gone over several major changes over the years. Not all builds have been listed 
on git hub so I also dumped old CSS folders in this place. Like many others, am never quite satisfied with the look of my site
and scrap it before completion. To see the current live site go over to cristianreyes.net
